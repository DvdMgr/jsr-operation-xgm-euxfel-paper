    X-ray gas monitors (XGMs) are operated at the European XFEL for
    non-invasive single-shot pulse energy measurements and average beam
    position monitoring.
    They are used for tuning and maintaining the self-amplified spontaneous
    emission (SASE) operation and for sorting single-shot experimental data
    according to the pulse-resolved energy monitor data. The XGMs were
    developed at DESY based on the specific requirements for the European
    XFEL. In total, six XGM units are continuously in operation. Here, the
    main principle and experimental setup of an XGM are summarized, and the
    locations of the six XGMs at the facility are shown.
    Pulse energy measurements at 0.134 nm wavelength are presented, exceeding
    1 mJ obtained with an absolute measurement uncertainty of 7–10%;
    correlations between different XGMs are shown, from which a SASE1 beamline
    transmission of 97% isdeduced. Additionally, simultaneous position
    measurements close to the undulator and at the end of the tunnel are
    shown, along with the correlation of beam position data simultaneously
    acquired by an XGM and an imager.

Keywords: free-electron lasers; photon diagnostics; hard X-rays.
